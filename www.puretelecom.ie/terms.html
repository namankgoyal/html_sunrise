The achievable download speed is the speed you should receive during use of the broadband service.</li>
		<li class="p">'FTTH - Fibre to the Home' Services (Instant, Premium and Lightning). If you can connect by Fibre to your Home, then the maximum achievable download speed on your line will be confirmed in advance of connection to the Services. Pure Telecom will commit to a maximum achievable and normally available download speed above 90% of the advertised speed. For example, on our Lightning Product (1Gbps) you should normally expect to achieve speeds above 900Mbps.</li>
		<li class="p">'FTTC - Fibre to the Cabinet' Service (up to a Maximum speed of 100Mbps). The normal download speed achievable for all of our FTTC customers should be above 80% of the maximum available download speed, as measured on your line after it has been connected to the Pure Telecom broadband service (i.e. for a line with 60Mbps maximum available, the normal speed achievable would be 54Mbps or more).</li>
		<li class="p">'Other Broadband' Services (up to a Maximum speed of 8Mbps). The normal download speed achievable for all of our Other Broadband services customers should be above 70% of the maximum available download speed, as measured on your line after it has been connected to the Pure Telecom broadband service (i.e. for a line with 8Mbps maximum available, the normal speed achievable would be 5.6Mbps or more).</li>
		<li class="p">Please note the line speed is different to the throughput rate you experience on your device. The throughput rate i.e. the speed you experience, can depend on a number of factors such as:
		<ol class="p list-secondary">
			<li class="p">Whether you are using Wi-Fi or direct fed cabling to connect devices in your home.</li>
			<li class="p">The number of devices connected to your Wi-Fi.</li>
			<li class="p">Interference with Wi-Fi signal from thickness of walls, distance from router and other household electrical signals.</li>
			<li class="p">The speed your devices run at.</li>
			<li class="p">The quality of your internal phone line wiring.</li>
			<li class="p">Potentially faulty equipment.</li>
			<li class="p">The capacity of the host provider of the content you are accessing.</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
		<li class="p">High ping times and jitter in the transmission of data or packet loss can result in your broadband running slowly, not loading web pages or you may experience problems with services like VOIP and VPNs. If there is packet loss or delay in broadband data transfer, certain applications may suffer from momentary interruptions. For example, the length of time to download a movie or a box-set might increase. The more third-party services you subscribe to and actively use simultaneously will have an impact on your speeds.</li>
		<li class="p">Our Instant, Premium, Lightning Fibre to the Home and Unlimited Fibre broadband services will generally have a maximum available upload speed of between 20 and 100 Mbps and can expect to achieve a normal upload speed of 5% of the maximum available upload speed or a minimum of 1Mbps (whichever is the greater). Our Other Broadband services will have a maximum available upload speed of 512kbps and can expect to achieve a normal upload speed of 25% of the maximum available upload speed or a minimum of 128Kbps (whichever is the greater).</li>
